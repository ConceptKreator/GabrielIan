Welcome. In case you hadn't already figured it out, my name is Gabriel, and you've arrived at my online home. This is where I keep my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>. This is also where I rant about all things design, usability, agile, and the intersection of those disciplines. You can also find my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and some outbound links to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/conceptkreator/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielroth/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

OK, so who am I? Well, I'm a father, a designer, an outdoor enthusiast, and an agilist. I love helping teams realize the potential they have to build amazing things. But, when I'm not coaching teams or consulting on some agile or usability study; I try to spend my spare time outdoors. I can usually be found (or not as is really the point) with my family, hiking, camping, kayaking, mountain biking, or snowboarding; really anything outdoorsy I can use as an excuse to be outside.
